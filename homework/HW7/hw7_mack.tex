{\bf prob didn't specify whether interaction -- I excluded -- check with john}

$H_{0}$: $\sigma^{2}_{part}$=0; $H_{A}$: $\sigma^{2}_{part} >$0

There is strong evidence of part to part variability after accounting for variation between inspectors ($F_{9,78}=430.82, P$\textless 0.0001).

$H_{0}$: $\sigma^{2}_{inspector}$=0; $H_{A}$: $\sigma^{2}_{inspector} >$0

There is strong evidence of variability between inspectors after accounting for part to part variability ($F_{2,78}=19.34,P$\textless 0.0001).

I am not familiar with the subject area. This sounds like an observational study, but if inspectors and parts were randomly assigned to induction motor starters, independence between replicates would be reasonable after accounting for inspector and part variability. It is also assumed parts, inspectors, and the residuals are all independent, and all parts are independent, all inspectors are independent, and all residuals are indpendent. These will be reasonable if, for the part, the effect of part 1 does not influence the effect of part 2, and likewise for the residuals and inspectors. Inspectors are human, and so may not be independent if trained in subgroups.

Normality is reasonable as all the residuals fall very close to the normal q-q line. There is one outlier residual near the predicted value of 30. However, it is not too extreme in magnitude and given the number of other residuals, we might expect at least one to be a bit larger by chance. Homogeneity of variance seems reasonable as there is random scatter in the residuals vs. predicted plot.

\item

{\it (1.5pt) Provide a practical interpretation of the variance component estimates in the context of the study.}

The variation in impedence within {\bf or is it between?} parts is estimated to be 48.47926. The variation in impedence within inspectors is estimated to be 0.62061 and the variation in impedence after accounting for part and  inspector is estimated to be 1.0151.

{\it (1.5pt) Consider the situation described in Problem 13.7, page 602. Provide estimates of the

{\bf by variance components does he mean mse or all the sums of squares... here it says assume operator is fixed, so really only one variance component...}

\item %3d

The largest effect occurs at 300 degrees, operator 2, and cycle 50 and so that is my recommendation.

\item 

{\it  (.5pt) If a target score of 30 is desirable, what set of factor conditions would you recommend?}

Want sum of effects to be 0, but not sure how to evaluate.

\item 
{\it  (1pt) Is there any serious problem with the model assumptions? If yes, what is the problem?}

Randomization would make independence of the residuals reasonable. The residuals vs. predicted plot shows random scatter, which suggests constant variance is reasonable. The Normal Q-Q plot shows two residuals that are quite large on the standardized scale and deviate from the normal q-q line, suggesting the normality assumption of the residuals may be violated. Looking a bit closer at the residuals vs. predicted plot we do see two residuals greater than 5 in absolute value near predicted values of 28 ad 35.
